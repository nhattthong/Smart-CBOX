I have modified and replaced components in a Huawei 4875 server power supply, upgrading it from 48V to 100V to adapt it for my EV bike.
This server power supply supports CANBUS control, which allows me to monitor and manage parameters such as AC and DC voltage, current, power, and more.
Of course, I have researched their knowledge from China they did it I asked them for help and found documents in their social media.
